This is an experimental project in which I analyze the ratings of Computer Science professors at Arizona State University on ratemyprofessors.com and try to understand the factors that affect a Computer Science professor's rating at ASU.

Structure of the project
  1. dataScrubber.py - This file contains the code that pulls data from ratemyprofessor.com and populates professors.csv and ratings.csv
  2. Ratings Analysis.ipynb - Ipython note that contains all the analysis.
